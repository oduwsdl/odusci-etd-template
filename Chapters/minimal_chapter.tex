\chapter{Introduction} 
This first paragraph will demonstrate some of the citation methods that can be used. The rest of the document is filler text used solely to demonstrate the desired layout.  This is a journal citation \autocite{berlin-tweb23}. This is a paper in a conference proceedings \autocite{weigle-jcdl23}. This is citing a poster \autocite{jayanetti-sbp23}. This is a tech report citation \autocite{weigle-2023}. This is citing an edited book, \textcite{vanet-book}, and demonstrates using the ``textcite'' command that will print the names of the authors along with the citation tag, allowing for easy use inside a sentence.  This is a journal article with 12 authors \autocite{coifman2005geometric}, but only 10 authors should be printed in the references, ending with ``\emph{et al.}'' before printing the article title.  Finally, this  demonstrates citing multiple references in a single command \autocites{jones-memento21,vanet-book,weigle-jcdl23}, but if they are near each other in the order the notation may be shortened in some styles \autocites{berlin-tweb23, weigle-jcdl23, jayanetti-sbp23}.
